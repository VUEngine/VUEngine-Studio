# Although it is generally not recommended to disable asar, it is required for Theia.
# Enabling this leads to: process ERROR Error: spawn ENOTDIR
# because binaries can not be executed from the asar archive.
# See asar file API limitations: https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/application-packaging#limitations-of-the-node-api

# node_modules and package.json are copied automatically
# Copying node_modules must be automatic for correct resolvement of binaries.
# Furthermore, This reduces bundle sizes significantly because it avoids duplicates of the electron runtime.
